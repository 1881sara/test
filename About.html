<h1>  --- Who we are ---</h1>
  <p>"Learning another language is not only  learning different words for<br> the same 
  things, but learning another way to think 
  about things."<br> ~ Flora Lewis</p>
  
 <p> Taleek was founded in 2020 as an application based on decades of
   experience, and with a sole vision to   enlighten the world and promote learning
     
 understand and are fully committed to
  solving the real-time linguistic challenges
   experienced by people by the provision of 
   high quality, individualized modern
    and  innovative practices with 
    professionalism, dignity, and respect.</p>
  
 <p> The world has become a global village.
  Language plays a vital role when it 
  comes to socializing or required expertise 
  for several tasks. As such, neither do 
  people meet the linguistic fluency required
   to secure opportunities nor do they find 
   an easy yet professional language learning 
   environment.</p>
  
 <p> Therefore, Taleek was founded with a vision
  to elevate and guide our learners in enhancing
   their productivity by utilizing our language 
   learning platform. We provide a platform for people 
   to learn various languages through our
    exclusive experts who work closely with 
    them to analyze their needs and provide
     solutions to solve challenges. Learning 
     being fluent in numerous languages would 
     rapidly increase and open new doors 
     of outreach and much more resulting in
     better productive and improved life.</p>
  
 <p> We use videos as the main medium of instruction
   and what makes us unique is our language
    of instruction. At Taleek we understand 
    the problems faced while learning non-native
     languages and we’ve proudly removed all
      those hurdles for you. Our experts teach
       you the language you seek in your native
        language. For example, if you’re French
      and seek to learn Arabic, our experts
          will teach you Arabic in French. Fun,
               isn’t it?</p>
